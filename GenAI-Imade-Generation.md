# AI Image Generation with Stable Diffusion Model on Google Colab

Welcome to this tutorial on generating stunning images using **Stable Diffusion**, one of the most powerful generative AI models available today. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore the basics of generative AI, its applications, and how you can use it to generate images based on text prompts.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to algorithms that can create new content, whether it's images, text, or music. Models like Stable Diffusion leverage deep learning techniques to interpret natural language and produce visuals that match the given description. It's widely used in:
- Art creation
- Prototyping designs
- Gaming and virtual environments
- Image editing and enhancement

### About Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image synthesis model developed by **Stability AI**. It's capable of generating high-quality, coherent images from simple text prompts. Hugging Face, a leading platform for machine learning models, provides pre-trained versions of Stable Diffusion along with tools to use and customize them.

## Setting Up the Environment on Google Colab

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Weâ€™ll install Hugging Face's `diffusers` library, along with PyTorch and other supporting libraries.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Run the following command in a Colab cell to install everything:

```python
!pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers accelerate torch bitsandbytes scipy safetensors xformers
```

> **Note**: This installs tools like:
> - `diffusers`: The library for text-to-image models.
> - `torch`: PyTorch for deep learning operations.
> - `xformers`: Improves performance by optimizing memory usage.
> - `safetensors`: Provides faster and safer model storage.

## Step 2: Import Required Libraries

Once the dependencies are installed, import the necessary libraries:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

## Step 3: Clear GPU Cache and Load the Model

Clear GPU memory and set up the Stable Diffusion model. We'll use Stability AI's `stable-diffusion-2-1` model hosted on Hugging Face.

```python
# Clear GPU memory
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Define the model ID (latest Stable Diffusion version)
model_id = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1"

# Load the Stable Diffusion model pipeline with half-precision for efficiency
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)

# Update the scheduler for faster and more accurate image generation
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)

# Move the pipeline to GPU
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
```

---

## Step 4: Generate an Image

Now, define your **text prompt** and use the pipeline to generate an image. You can customize the `prompt`, `width`, and `height` to experiment with different outputs.

```python
# Define the prompt for the image
prompt = "a serene house in front of the ocean during sunset"

# Generate the image with the specified dimensions
image = pipe(prompt, width=1000, height=1000).images[0]

# Display the generated image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')  # Hide axes for a clean view
plt.show()
```

---

## Step 5: Save the Image (Optional)

You might want to save the generated image locally for future use. Hereâ€™s how:

```python
# Save the generated image
image.save("generated_image.png")
print("Image saved as 'generated_image.png'")
```
