## Project 1: Churn Prediction Model
In this end to end project you will use a classification model to predict customer churning (whether the customer will leave or stay!). Its a classic ML problem and the END - TO - END nature of this project will also help you understand how to train, save and load your models to do some predictions. This is going to be amazing!
